# Landmarks - Learning Project SwiftUI

This is my first repo demonstrating SwiftUI.

Using this UI framework we can build the UI faster.

SwiftUI composes its layout by combining many views into a scene. 

View /
    LandmarkList
    
Model /
  Data
  RoomStore
  Landmark

  
Moreover when we go deeper we have to understand how to properly provide data to SwiftUI.

Therefore there is new concept in Swift which is binding. 

We will implement on the model class.
